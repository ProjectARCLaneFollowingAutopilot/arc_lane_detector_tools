/* DESCRIPTION:
Use this class to fit a polynomial or spline to a set of points.
Input shall be: Set of points, (type of function to fit), number of iterations, thresholds
Output shall be: parameters of the fitted curve/function.

At the beginning: Only implement one curve type: 2nd order polynomial: f(x) = a*xÂ² + b*x + c
